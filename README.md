# Automate my front desk job at City Dance Studios

### Why

Because I'm tired of manually writing sheets to check in people, and then sending snapshots of the sheets to my manager at the end of the day

### The Solution

A kiosk application that:

- checks in people that arrive to the studio
- if they haven't paid yet, show them a venmo code to pay with the amount
- at the end of the day, generate a sheet with the names, payment methods, and total amount for the class
